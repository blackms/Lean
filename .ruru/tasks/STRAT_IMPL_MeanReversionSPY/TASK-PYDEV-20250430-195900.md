# Implement SPY Daily Mean-Reversion Strategy (V1 - RSI+ATR+KR)

## 1. Description

Implement the V1 algorithmic trading strategy designed in task `TASK-ARCH-20250430-193100`. This involves creating a Python algorithm for the QuantConnect LEAN platform, including a custom implementation of the Kernel Regression indicator.

## 2. Goal

Translate the defined strategy design into functional Python code within the LEAN framework.

## 3. Design Reference

Refer to the **V1 Design Summary** section in the linked design task file:
`.ruru/tasks/STRAT_DESIGN_NewStrategy/TASK-ARCH-20250430-193100.md`

Key elements:
*   **Asset/Timeframe:** SPY Daily
*   **Indicators:** RSI(14), ATR(14), Custom Kernel Regression (L=80, h=15, Gaussian)
*   **Entry:** RSI signal filtered by price relative to KR line.
*   **Exit:** RSI cross 50 OR ATR(1.5x) SL OR ATR(3.0x) PT.

## 4. Implementation Checklist

- [✅] Create a new Python file in `Algorithm.Python/` (e.g., `MeanReversionSpyRsiKr.py`).
- [✅] Define the main algorithm class inheriting from `QCAlgorithm`.
- [✅] **Implement Custom Kernel Regression Indicator:**
    - [✅] Create a new Python class for the indicator, inheriting from `PythonIndicator` or similar base.
    - [✅] Implement the Nadaraya-Watson logic using a Gaussian kernel.
    - [✅] Handle rolling window updates efficiently.
    - [✅] Ensure it accepts lookback (L) and bandwidth (h) parameters.
    - [✅] Add comments explaining the implementation.
- [✅] **Initialize Algorithm:**
    - [✅] Set start/end dates, initial cash.
    - [✅] Add SPY Daily data subscription.
    - [✅] Initialize standard RSI(14) indicator.
    - [✅] Initialize standard ATR(14) indicator.
    - [✅] Initialize the custom KernelRegression(80, 15) indicator.
    - [✅] Warm up all indicators.
- [✅] **Implement OnData Logic:**
    - [✅] Check if indicators are ready.
    - [✅] Get current RSI, ATR, KR values.
    - [✅] Get current Close price.
    - [✅] Check for existing positions.
    - [✅] **Implement Entry Logic:**
        - [✅] Check Long condition: RSI < 30 AND Close < KR.Value.
        - [✅] Check Short condition: RSI > 70 AND Close > KR.Value.
        - [✅] If entry condition met and no position exists, calculate position size (start with fixed size, e.g., allocate 95% portfolio).
        - [✅] Place Market Order for entry.
    - [✅] **Implement Exit Logic (if position exists):**
        - [✅] Calculate SL price (EntryPrice - 1.5 * ATR for long, EntryPrice + 1.5 * ATR for short). (Handled via Order Placement)
        - [✅] Calculate PT price (EntryPrice + 3.0 * ATR for long, EntryPrice - 3.0 * ATR for short). (Handled via Order Placement)
        - [✅] Place StopMarketOrder for SL. (Handled via OnOrderEvent -> PlaceStopLossAndProfitTarget)
        - [✅] Place LimitOrder for PT. (Handled via OnOrderEvent -> PlaceStopLossAndProfitTarget)
        - [✅] Check RSI exit condition: (Is Long AND RSI > 50) OR (Is Short AND RSI < 50). If met, liquidate position.
- [✅] Add basic logging for entries/exits (optional but helpful).
- [✅] Review code for clarity and adherence to LEAN practices.
