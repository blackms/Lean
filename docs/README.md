## Key Concepts

QuantConnect Lean is built around several key concepts:

1. **Modularity**: The system is designed with a modular architecture, allowing components to be easily replaced or extended.

2. **Event-Driven**: The system processes market data and other events in an event-driven manner, with algorithms responding to these events.

3. **Framework-Based**: The Algorithm Framework provides a structured approach to building trading strategies, separating concerns into distinct components:
   - Alpha Models (signal generation)
   - Portfolio Construction (position sizing)
   - Execution (order placement)
   - Risk Management (risk control)
   - Universe Selection (asset selection)

4. **Multi-Asset**: Supports multiple asset classes including equities, options, futures, forex, and cryptocurrencies.

5. **Backtesting and Live Trading**: The same code can be used for both backtesting and live trading, ensuring consistency.

## Getting Started

For developers new to the codebase, we recommend starting with the [Architecture Overview](./architecture/README.md) to understand the high-level design, followed by exploring the [Core Components](./components/README.md) to understand the fundamental building blocks of the system.

For those interested in implementing trading strategies, the [Strategy Implementation](./strategies/README.md) section provides detailed information on how to create and customize trading strategies using the Algorithm Framework.
